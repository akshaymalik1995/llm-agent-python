# AI Agent with Python

This project aims to develop an AI agent with the following key characteristics and capabilities:

- **Independent Core Logic:** The agent will be built from scratch in Python, without reliance on third-party frameworks such as Langchain or LangGraph.
- **LLM-Powered Tool Usage:** The integrated LLM will be capable of utilizing a defined set of tools, starting with file manipulation and command-line execution.
- **Scalable Tool Integration:** The system will be designed for easy expansion, allowing new tools to be developed and integrated as needed.
- **Iterative Task Processing:** The agent will possess the ability to make sequential decisions about tool usage to achieve complex objectives.
- **Direct System Interaction:** A dedicated terminal interface will allow the agent to run commands and retrieve results, enabling direct interaction with the operating environment.


## 1. Core Architecture

This section will describe the main components of the AI agent and how they interact.

### 1.1. LLM Integration
    - Details on how the LLM will be invoked (e.g., API calls, local model).
    - Prompt engineering strategies for effective tool use and iterative reasoning.
    - Handling LLM responses and extracting actionable information.

### 1.2. Tool Abstraction Layer
    - Design of the interface for tools (e.g., a base `Tool` class).
    - How tools are registered and made available to the LLM.
    - Input/output specifications for tools.

### 1.3. Iterative Processing Loop
    - The main loop that drives the agent's actions.
    - How the agent maintains state between iterations.
    - Decision-making logic for selecting tools or asking for clarification.
    - Criteria for task completion or failure.

### 1.4. Terminal Interaction Module
    - Mechanism for executing shell commands (e.g., using `subprocess` module).
    - Parsing and returning command output (stdout, stderr, exit codes) to the LLM.
    - Security considerations for executing arbitrary commands.

## 2. Tool Implementation and Extensibility

Details on the initial set of tools and the process for adding new ones.

### 2.1. Standard Tools (Examples)
    - `read_file`:
      - Functionality: Read file content.
      - Parameters: File path.
      - Expected output: File content, error messages if any.
    - `execute_command`:
      - Functionality: Run shell commands in the integrated terminal.
      - Parameters: Command string.
      - Expected output: Command output, exit code.
  
### 2.2. Adding New Tools
    - Process for defining a new tool class.
    - Required methods/attributes for a new tool.
    - How to register the new tool with the agent's toolset.
    - Examples of potential future tools (e.g., `web_search`).

## 3. Agent Decision Making

How the agent iteratively decides which tools to use.

### 3.1. Prompting Strategy
    - System prompts to guide the LLM's reasoning process.
    - How the available tools and their descriptions are presented to the LLM.
    - Format for the LLM to specify the tool to use and its arguments.

### 3.2. Handling Ambiguity and Errors
    - Strategies for when the LLM's output is unclear or a tool fails.
    - How the agent might ask for clarification or retry an operation.

## 4. Future Enhancements
    - Ideas for long-term development.
    - Example: Memory module for recalling past interactions.
    - Example: Support for concurrent tool execution.
    - Example: More sophisticated error handling and recovery.

## 5. Development and Testing
    - Development and Testing
    - Testing strategy (unit tests, integration tests).
