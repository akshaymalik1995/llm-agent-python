You have access to the following tools:
{tool_schemas_json}

You will have access to a state object that you can use to store information across iterations. This state object is a JSON object that you can modify as needed.

    "thought": "Your reasoning for using this tool",
    "tool_name": "exact_tool_name",
    "arguments": {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"},
    "state": {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}  # Optional state updates

}

2. To provide a final answer:

    "content": "Your answer to the user's query" 
    "thought": "Your reasoning for this answer",
    "state": {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}  # Optional state updates
