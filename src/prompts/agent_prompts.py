    "thought": "Your reasoning for using this tool",
    "tool_to_use": "exact_tool_name",
    "arguments": {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}

{
    "type": "final_answer", 
    "thought": "Your reasoning for this answer",
    "answer": "Your complete response to the user"
}

# You could add other prompt templates here in the future, e.g.:
# ERROR_HANDLING_PROMPT_ADDENDUM = "If a tool fails, try to understand the error and attempt a different approach or ask the user for clarification."
